# Developing MindLeak

From a clean machine to the engine building, tested, and the extension running.
If you get stuck, that is a defect — fix it or add it to [Known gaps](#known-gaps).

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.75+ (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)); MSVC toolchain on Windows.
- **Node** 18+ and npm (for the VS Code extension).
- **Python** 3.8+ with `pip` (for the `pre-commit` framework).

## One-time setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/monk-eee/MindLeak
cd MindLeak

# Rust components
rustup component add rustfmt clippy

# Pre-commit hooks (client-side enforcement)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push

# Extension dependencies
npm --prefix editors/vscode install
```

On systems with `make`, `make setup` does the hook + extension steps.

**Success looks like:** `cargo test --all` reports `test result: ok` for every
crate, and `target/debug/mindleak-mcp` starts and prints
`[mindleak-mcp] ready — graph at …` on stderr.

## Everyday commands

| Task | `make` | Direct command |
|---|---|---|
| Build | `make build` | `cargo build` |
| Test | `make test` | `cargo test --all` |
| Format | `make fmt` | `cargo fmt --all` |
| Format check | `make fmt-check` | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` |
| Lint (Rust) | `make clippy` | `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` |
| Lint (extension) | `make ext-lint` | `npm --prefix editors/vscode run lint` |
| Test (extension) | `make ext-test` | `npm --prefix editors/vscode test` |
| Compile extension | `make ext-compile` | `npm --prefix editors/vscode run compile` |
| Everything CI runs | `make ci` | see [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) |

> **`make` is optional.** Every target maps to the direct command in the
> right-hand column — `cargo`, `npm`, and `git` are identical on Linux, macOS,
> and Windows, so run those directly if `make` is unavailable.

## Local gate before a PR

Do your laundry locally — CI is the safety net, not the first line of defence:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all
npm --prefix editors/vscode run lint
npm --prefix editors/vscode test
npm --prefix editors/vscode run compile
```

## Publishing a binary release

The tag-driven [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) publishes both
MCP servers for Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS Intel, and macOS Apple Silicon.
It reruns `make ci`, performs native MCP initialization/tool-list smoke checks,
attests the staged files, and publishes platform archives plus `SHA256SUMS`.

1. Update `[workspace.package].version` in [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) and finish
  the corresponding changelog entry.
2. Merge the release commit to `main` and confirm CI is green.
3. Create and push a matching tag:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Prerelease tags such as `v0.1.0-preview.1` may share the base workspace version
`0.1.0`. A mismatched or malformed tag fails before any binaries are built.

## Pre-commit

Hooks run automatically on `git commit` (formatting, lint, whitespace, JSON/TOML
validity) and on `git push` (the test suite). Never bypass with `--no-verify`;
fix the code instead. Configuration: [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml).

## Running the MCP server by hand

```bash
MINDLEAK_DB="$PWD/.mindleak/graph.db" cargo run -p mindleak-mcp
```

Then paste newline-delimited JSON-RPC requests on stdin, e.g.:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
```

> Pipe a request file to the server's stdin from any shell/harness — it reads
> one JSON object per line: `mindleak-mcp < in.jsonl > out.jsonl`.

## Debugging the extension

```bash
cargo build              # produce target/debug/mindleak-mcp(.exe)
npm --prefix editors/vscode run watch
```

Press **F5** in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host. The extension
auto-detects the workspace `target/debug` or `target/release` binary.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `MINDLEAK_DB` | `<cwd>/.mindleak/graph.db` | server graph location |
| `MINDLEAK_AGENT` | *(empty)* | agent id for attribution (`observed` edges); empty = off |
| `MINDLEAK_LLM_URL` | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | consolidation server (OpenAI-compatible) |
| `MINDLEAK_MODEL` | `glm4:9b` | consolidation model |
| `MINDLEAK_LLM_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | bearer token for hosted LLM servers (optional) |

## Adding an MCP tool

1. Add a method to the `MindLeak` facade in [`lib.rs`](crates/mindleak-core/src/lib.rs).
2. Add a definition to `list()` and a branch to `call()` in
   [`tools.rs`](crates/mindleak-mcp/src/tools.rs).
3. Add a test in [`tests/integration.rs`](crates/mindleak-core/tests/integration.rs).
4. Add a row to the tool table in [`README.md`](README.md).

## Known gaps

Be honest — an empty Known Gaps section is almost always a lie. The rough edges
and footguns, with impact and status:

- **Symbol and import extraction remains heuristic and partially scoped.** —
  Static JS/TS named imports now produce cross-file `calls`, but default and
  namespace calls, re-exports, path aliases, dynamic imports, and other language
  import syntaxes are not resolved. Non-JS brace/indent extractors also remain
  regex-based. — Medium impact on graph completeness. — Tracked: expand
  fixture-backed deterministic parsers; Tree-sitter remains the precision
  upgrade (ADR-0002).
- **The live LLM round-trip runs only on demand, not in CI.** — Ignored tests
  (`cargo test -- --ignored`) exercise the real `/v1/chat/completions` call for
  both planes (MindLeak `consolidate`, Lodestar `decompose`/`judge`) against a
  running model; CI can't run them without one. — Low impact. — Running them
  surfaced (and fixed) that `glm4:9b` wraps its JSON in prose even with
  `response_format: json_object`; both clients now extract the JSON object
  robustly.
- **Ingest tools are unauthenticated (by design).** — Any client with stdio
  access to `mindleak-mcp` can write nodes/edges. — Acceptable for local
  single-user use; the server has no network listener. Do not expose it over a
  network without an auth layer (see [docs/SPEC.md § 8](docs/SPEC.md)).
- **Lodestar conformance reads caller-supplied node ids, not live MindLeak
  telemetry.** — `check_conformance` computes drift/violation from the goal↔code
  links plus the change set the caller passes; it does not yet query MindLeak's
  actual `modified`/`failed_on` edges to confirm what really changed. — Medium
  impact on conformance accuracy. — Deferred; the loose node-id seam (ADR-0004)
  is intentional, the deeper read is a follow-up.
- **Lodestar worktree sharing is path-based, not git-aware.** — The Intent Plane
  DB resolves from `LODESTAR_DB` else `<cwd>/.lodestar/spec.db`; sibling git
  worktrees share one plane only if pointed at the same path. — Low impact. —
  Git-common-dir auto-resolution is a documented follow-up (SPEC-INTENT §3).
- **Unit Test MCP 1.3.6 cannot validate this workspace reliably.** — Its Vitest
  discovery finds `src/util.test.ts`, but `run_tests` reports a passing total of
  zero even for that explicit path. On Windows, a backslash Cargo root is
  rejected as `INVALID_ROOT_DIR`; normalizing it to forward slashes runs the
  custom command and surfaces failures, but successful runs still report zero
  tests and no coverage. — High impact on local proof: MCP cannot establish test
  counts or coverage. — Left open in the external adapter; CI remains the
  authoritative complete-suite signal until repaired.
- **The extension toolchain has one low-severity development advisory.** —
  Vitest resolves `esbuild` 0.27.7, affected by GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr when its
  development server runs on Windows. `npm audit --omit=dev` is clean and the
  package is not shipped with the extension; a normal `npm audit fix` finds no
  compatible update. — Low impact. — Left open until Vitest accepts a fixed
  `esbuild`; do not use `--force` to hide the compatibility decision.
- **Lodestar core tests are not isolated from a running local model.** — With an
  OpenAI-compatible server reachable at the default URL,
  `decompose_falls_back_to_single_task_without_llm` can return multiple tasks and
  `conformance_flags_ungoverned_as_aligned_and_governed_as_drift` can escalate
  drift to violation. — High impact on test determinism: `cargo test --all`
  depends on the developer's local services. — Left open for a dedicated
  Lodestar test seam; tests must inject an unreachable/mock client rather than
  depending on ambient model availability.
